# The `let` keyword

`let` allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the `var` keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

## Declaring function scoped variables

The JavaScript variables that are declared using the var keyword are called as function scoped variables. The function scoped variables are accessible globally to the script, that is, throughout the script, if declared outside a function. Similarly, if the function scoped variables are declared inside a function, then they become accessible throughout the function, but not outside the function.

```javascript
var tomato = 'üçÖ'; //accessible globally

function myFunction() {
  console.log(tomato)

  var pear = 'üçê' //accessible throughout function

  if (true) {
    var meat = 'üçñ' // accessible throughout function
    console.log(pear)
  }

  console.log(meat)
}

myFunction()
```

## Declaring block scoped variables

Variables that are declared using the `let` keyword are called as block scoped variables. The block scoped variables behave the same way as the function scoped variables when declared outside a function, that is, they are accessible globally.

```javascript
let tomato = 'üçÖ'; //accessible globally

function myFunction() {
  console.log(tomato)

  let pear = 'üçê' //accessible throughout function

  if (true) {
    let meat = 'üçñ' // accessible throughout the "if" statement
    console.log(pear)
  }

  console.log(meat)
}

myFunction()
```

## Re-declaring variables

When you declare a variable using the var keyword that is already declared using var keyword (in the same scope) then it's overwritten.

```javascript
var a = 'üçÖ'
var a = 'üçñ'

console.log(a)

function myFunction() {
 var b = 'üçñ'
 var b = 'üçê'
 console.log(b)
}

myFunction() // 'üçñ' 'üçê'
```

When you declare a variable with a name that's already accessible in a function (or inner function), or is a sub-block using var or the let keyword respectively, then it's a different variable.

```javascript
var a = 1
let b = 2

function myFunction() {
  var a = 3 //different variable
  let b = 4 //different variable

  if(true) {
    var a = 5 //overwritten
    let b = 6 //different variable

    console.log(a) // 5
    console.log(b) // 6
  }

  console.log(a) // 5
  console.log(b) // 4
}

myFunction();

console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2
```

You may be wondering why not just make the `var` keyword to define the block-scoped variables instead of introducing the `let` keyword? The reason why the
`var` keyword wasn't made enough to define block-scoped variables, instead of introducing the `let` keyword, was for the sake of backward compatibility.
